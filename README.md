instructions for devs:
basically you want to go to Assets/Assets/Modules and create a new scene using my template by going to File > New Scene
Once you've created your scene that's your "module" so make everything in there
I'll organize files in the Assets/Assets folder by making folders such as "scripts", "materials", "prefabs", etc. so organize any new assets you make accordingly.

haven't decided yet but i think we're gonna work with branches

some things to keep in mind:
make sure all interactable objects (objects you can hold) have the "interactable" layer assigned or you'll start skydiving when moving (yes unity is very weird)
